- **PRONUNCIATION**

    All humans develop muscle memory based on the pronunciation rules of their native language; in order to sound more like a native speaker in a second language, we need to consciously change our learned patterns in our new language. The resources below will give you examples that you can practice to train your mouth.

    Try contrasting some minimal pairs when you are doing monotonous work, like washing the dishes or taking a shower. 

    The key here is not to 'learn' these concepts, but rather to train in them. It is better to do a few minutes of drills once a day than an hour of drills once a week.

- **MY PROBLEM**

    Hi!

    I have a site for my English mentoring business, and I've had a couple of people tell me that it  doesn't look good on mobile. Can you help me with that?

    Here's my url:

    webdevenglish.com

- **YOUR SOLUTION**

    Hey!
    I visited your website. I loved its UI, colors, and simplicity; it is beautifully designed and functioning well. However, as you said I have also noticed some layout issues with mobile phones. In the web development world, this is a widespread issue, and it is known as less responsiveness of websites. This is because CSS is not appropriately written for mobile screens.

    I need access to your website's codebase. I'll fix this within 24 hours. I'll make sure that it looks good on all screen sizes, no matter if it's big TV or a small iPhone. In addition to that, I have noticed a few more things that need improvement. Here is an example.

    ![DESCRIBING%20+%20MARKETING%207c7aa5e0343b442fa783f59ac3683c95/Screenshot_2021-02-16_112310.png](DESCRIBING%20+%20MARKETING%207c7aa5e0343b442fa783f59ac3683c95/Screenshot_2021-02-16_112310.png)

    This button will look better if it has some padding around its borders.

    ![DESCRIBING%20+%20MARKETING%207c7aa5e0343b442fa783f59ac3683c95/Screenshot_2021-02-16_112639.png](DESCRIBING%20+%20MARKETING%207c7aa5e0343b442fa783f59ac3683c95/Screenshot_2021-02-16_112639.png)

    Here is how it looks after giving some padding to that button. Both buttons look equal and consistent.

    And also, social media links in the footer are redirecting back to the homepage. We can fix that as well. If you wish, we can add content to your about page, which is currently blank, which will look much more professional.

    There are few more things to talk about. That will be better for meeting.
